#Object Retrieval From Videos

This is a scientific research project in Computer Vision which aims to find object in the video and answer the time the object appears in the video in ranked list form.

##Motivation

* Support human limitation in memorizing objects.
* Help finding lost objects in daily life.
* Propose a novel method which applies Computer Vision into real life.
* Learn and implement Bag-of-Words model.

##Compilation

1. Create folders: asym, norm, tfidf, queryImg, train data (photoshop), Query.
2. Put all the database images of objects in train data (photoshop).
3. Put the frames extracted from the video in Query folder.
4. Put the image of object you need to find in the video in queryImg folder.
5. Change the path of the source and destination folder in file DEMO.m to run properly. 
The present path in DEMO.m is:
```
E:\APCS Program\SC203-Scientific Research\DEMO SC203\...
```
You should change it into:
```
(Current directory)\...\DEMO SC203\...
```
